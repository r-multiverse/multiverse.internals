\title{Review a package.}
\usage{
review_package(name, url, advisories = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Character string, name of the package to check.}

\item{url}{Either a character string with the package URL or
a custom JSON string with a package entry.}

\item{advisories}{Character vector of names of packages with advisories
in the R Consortium Advisory Database.
If \code{NULL}, then \code{review_package_text()} downloads the advisory database and
checks if the package has a vulnerability listed there.
The advisory database is cached internally for performance.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE}
if there is a problem with the package entry,
otherwise \code{FALSE} if there are no issues.
In either case, \code{\link[=review_package]{review_package()}} prints an R console message with
the result.

For security reasons, \code{\link[=review_package]{review_package()}} might only print the first
finding it encounters. If that happens, there will be an informative
note at the end of the console message.
