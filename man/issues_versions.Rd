\title{Check package versions.}
\usage{
issues_versions(versions)
}
\arguments{
\item{versions}{Character of length 1, file path to a JSON manifest
tracking the history of released versions of packages.
The official versions file for R-multiverse is maintained and
updated periodically at
\url{https://github.com/r-multiverse/checks/blob/main/versions.json}.}
}
\value{
A named list of information about packages which do not comply
with version number history checks. Each name is a package name,
and each element contains specific information about version
non-compliance: the current version number, the current version hash,
and the analogous versions and hashes of the highest-versioned
release recorded.
}
\description{
Check package version number history for compliance.
}
\details{
This function checks the version number history of packages
in R-multiverse and reports any packages with issues. The current
released version of a given package must be unique, and it must be
greater than all the versions of all the previous package releases.
}
\section{Package issues}{

Functions like \code{\link[=issues_versions]{issues_versions()}} and \code{\link[=issues_descriptions]{issues_descriptions()}}
perform health checks for all packages in R-multiverse.
Only packages that pass these checks go to the production repository at
\url{https://production.r-multiverse.org}. For a complete list of checks, see
the \verb{issues_*()} functions listed at
\url{https://r-multiverse.org/multiverse.internals/reference.html}.
\code{\link[=record_versions]{record_versions()}} updates the version number history
of releases in R-multiverse, and \code{\link[=record_issues]{record_issues()}} gathers
together all the issues about R-multiverse packages.
