# multiverse.internals 0.4.10

* Simplify `stage_candidates()` and `rclone_includes()`: get remote hashes from pre-recorded `issues.json`, as opposed to a separate call to `meta_packages()`. This ensures those remote hashes are more contemporaneous with the corresponding reported check results.

# multiverse.internals 0.4.9

* In `stage_candidates()`, ensure that removing a package from Community does not automatically remove it from Staging during the candidate freeze.

# multiverse.internals 0.4.8

* Sort `staged.json`.

# multiverse.internals 0.4.7

* Remove the `types` argument of `stage_candidates()`.

* Record healthy packages in `record_issues()` to support the above.

# multiverse.internals 0.3.9

# multiverse.internals 0.2.14

* Allow `update_staging()` to work if the staging `packages.json` does not exist.
